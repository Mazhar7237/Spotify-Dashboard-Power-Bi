1. Data Filters and Selection
Track and Artist Filters: Good use of slicers at the top to filter data by track and artist. This lets users dynamically explore specific songs or artists.
Time Filters (Year, Quarter, Month, Day): Nice job including multiple time filters to analyze trends across different periods. However, consider arranging these slicers more consistently to save space or improve readability.
2. Key Metrics (KPI Cards)
First Track and Artist Names: Displaying the first track and artist names is an interesting choice, though you might want to clarify the purpose of these metrics for viewers.
Sum of Streams, Average Stream Per Year, and Other KPIs: These provide quick insights into the datasetâ€™s overall trends. For the large values (e.g., "Sum of Streams - 489bn"), ensure they have clear labels for users to interpret.
Formatting: Use consistent formatting for large numbers. For example, instead of "489bn," you might label it as "489B" or "489 Billion."
3. Bar Chart - Sum of Streams by Track Name
This chart does an excellent job of ranking tracks based on streams, making it easy to identify top tracks.
Feedback: Consider sorting by streams in descending order (if not already done) to show the most popular songs at the top. Adding labels for each bar with stream numbers would make it even more informative.
4. Line Chart - Count of Tracks by Year
This visualization helps illustrate the number of tracks released over time, with a noticeable spike in recent years.
Feedback: Consider adjusting the axis labels to show more years or using a logarithmic scale if the data covers many decades. This would help reduce crowding and make year-to-year trends more visible.
5. Gauges - Danceability, Energy, and Other Percent Metrics
The gauges for danceability and energy percentages are visually engaging and provide an at-a-glance view of average values.
Feedback: Consider placing the exact percentages near the center or side of each gauge for clarity. It may also help to provide a reference range to help users understand what is high or low.
6. Additional Suggestions
Color Theme: Your dashboard has a consistent color theme, which keeps it visually appealing and focused. However, a more vivid contrast between text and background could improve readability.
Title and Explanation: Adding a title and a short description at the top can guide users on what the dashboard represents.
Interactivity: Ensure all visuals interact with each other. For example, selecting a particular year or track in one chart should update other visuals accordingly.
